# comp3170-newt-example
Example of using JOGL **N**ativ**E W**indowing **T**oolkit.

This is an example of a basic COMP3170 program which uses NEWT instead of Swing + GLCanvas. There are many advantages to using NEWT instead of the Swing framework, notably:

- Better performance as it uses native windows
- More reliable and less buggy than Swing
- Less boilerplate code to get a window going
- More purpose-built for OpenGL
